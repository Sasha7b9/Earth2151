1. Meshes description

Game uses 3D meshes stoted in MSH format in Meshes directory.

To create mesh in MSH format you have to do following steps:
a) create 3D object in #D Studio MAX v3.1
b) export object to AOD format using "EARTH2150 Utility" plugin
c) convert AOD file into MSH format using AOD2MSH.EXE program
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. How to install Plugin

Just copy EarthExp.dle into your MAX plugin's directory.
Plugin called "Earth 2150 Utility" will be located in the Utilities Tab.

3. How to create object

---
3.1 Look at the examples 

Use our example file EDUST1.MAX
This file included small ED tank chassis.
You can modify it.

We use MAX Spot lights as special objects. Please do not remove any of them.
If there is a number after the name of the slot it usually means that
you can add more slots of that type (e.g. SLOT_SC1, SLOT_SC2...)
All slots are listed later in that chapter.

As you can see in the example the tank "stands" on the XY plane, it's pivot point
is exactly in the 0,0,0 point and its front points in the direction of the X axis.
That means that inside the game ground level (or water for ships) will be in the
place of XY plane and the unit will move towards positive values of X axis.
It will also use it's pivot point for turning.

Notice that there is only one root object and it's name is the same
as the name of the file. It is called the main object and all other
objects and slots have to be linked to it.

The second file - EDWCA1.MAX - is the turret for the tank.
It's pivot and direction is like in previous example.
Inside the game it will be attached to the SLOT_SC1 of the tank (pivot to pivot).

Now look at the barrel: it is linked to the body of the turret and is animated.
It has also SLOT_MI1 (missile) linked to it.
Animation is very short and is played back during shooting.
The name of this object is very important: LC1S0E5K20.
L - is the type of the object (L means that this is a barrel, P is "regular" subobject)
C - (optional) is type of the animation (if any). C means not looped animation.
	(there are also looped animations - A, and "gate" (forward or backward) animations -B).
1 - number of subobject (unanimated barrel would be named L1 instead of LC1)
S0 - number of the first frame of animation
E5 - number of the last frame of animation
K20 - maximum angle the barrel can be rised

There can be lots of information inside the objects name, most of
whoch is optional and there's no need to discribe all of it right now.

You can check now how the tank looks in MAX:
open EDUST1.MAX, merge all objects from EDWCA1.MAX and
place object EDWCA1 on the light called SLOT_SC1 (aligning their pivots).

Now look at EDBBC.MAX file. It is one of ED buildings,
notice that it is bigger than tank, have diffrent slots
and is placed in diffrent way than vehicles (see p.3.2).
It also has three looping animations (PA_S_E_), two of them are spinning radars,
and third is an animated light (one of many features not described in this file ;) ).

3.2 Dimensions and placement of vehicles and buildings

The game uses grid of sqares 8x8 MAX units each. That means that vehicles
shouldn't exceed dimensions of 8x8 units or they will overlap in the game.
For scaling purposes use example files included with this doc.

Vehicles are placed in the middle of the 3DS MAX world (point 0,0,0)
and they shouldn't be bigger than "ingame square" (8x8 units).

Buildings can be up to 4 "squares" big in any direction (32 units)
and they are placed inside the "bottom right" of the XY plane (X>0, Y<0).
Pivot point is always in 0,0,0 while the building spreads in (+X) and (-Y) directions.
To tell the game how big is the building there are special objects called "heights".


---
3.2 The most important rules for creating ingame objects:

- Pivot point of the main object ALWAYS must be placed at point 0,0,0
- There can be only one main (root) object and its name should match
	the name of the file, all other objects including slots are linked to it
- All objects (except slots) have to be of Editable Mesh type
- Pivots of ALL objects (geometry, not slots) in the scene MUST be aligned to world
- All (geometry) objects MUST have reseted X-Forms and collapsed stacks
	(although when objects is Editable Mesh it's still possible to export it with
	some Edit Mesh and Unwrap UVW modifiers in the stack)
- Every objects should have exactly ONE material. If you need more than one texture
	on a mesh use Multi/SubObject Material and Material ID feature of EditableMesh
- All geometry MUST have at least one texture applied (game uses only Diffuse
	texture slot in materials, other textures and colors are ignored)
- All faces should have mapping coordinates, or MAX will use random UVW values
	which sometimes causes a crash while exporting to AOD.
- Animated objects must have proper names (with animation type A/B/C and S_E_ section)
	and there must be keys on the first and the last frame specified in the name
	of the object for each animated modifiers
- For animation of Position and Rotation transforms TCB controllers must be used.
	Animation of Scale isn't supported. Main objects and slots can't be animated.

3.3 List of slots:

Notice: Vehicles have one SLOT_HT1 and one SLOT_SM1,
	buildings four pairs of them (HT1 - HT4, SM1-SM4)
	Each object should have also SLOT_CE.

a) Slots common for units and buildings:

SLOT_CE	- center (not pivot point!), small meshes in the interface are spinning around it
SLOT_SC1	- this light determine where cannon should be attached to the tank.
	you can add more if you want to create object with more cannons (max is 4)
SLOT_MI1	- (MIssile) point where missiles appear during shooting (usually end of the barrel)

SLOT_HT1 - (HiT) - point where enemy missiles will hit the object
SLOT_SM1 - (SMoke) - point where black smoke will be emitted after hit

LIGHT_HL1	- (headlight) - light switched on during night. You can change color
	and brightness of the light and those parameters will be used in game.
	You can also change cone angle and length. 

b) Optional unit slots:

SLOT_ST1	- (Smoke Trace) - emits dust when a vehicle is going on sand
SLOT_SE1	- (Smoke Engine) - exhaust pipe
SLOT_SK1 - (Smoke Kilwater) - water trail at the rear end of boats and amphibias 

c) Special building slots:

SLOT_TR1 - (TRansport) - unloading place for land ore transporters, for mines and refineries only
SLOT_PR - (PRoduction) - place where new units appear (inside the factory),
SLOT_MV - (MoVe) - place where new unit goes after production (from SLOT_PR),
		it must be exactly in the middle of the 8x8 units box and outside the factory
SLOT_L - Landing zone for flying transporters 
SLOT_CH1 - (CHimney) - chimney smoke

WARNING: Slots TR, PR, MV and L must be exactly in the middle of the 8x8 units box

4. How to export object to AOD

Make sure that all objects are correct :)
Use "Earth 2150 Utility".
Functions of plugin:
	1. CHECK - checks object without saving
	2. EXPORT - checks objects and, if correct, saves *.MAX and exports *.AOD
	4. CONVERT - converts all *.MAX files in given directory to *.AOD
	5. RUN VIEWER - doesn't work anymore.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. How to convert AOD to MSH

If toy have AOD file ready you can easily convert it into MSH format:

Syntax:
  aod2MSH.EXE objectname.aod

Example:
  aod2MSH.EXE EDUST1.aod

File EDUST1 will be generated.

ATTENTION:
This program will check if object name is the same as file name
and if all textures for object exist. To avoid error messages
you have to run this program from meshes directory in the following subtree:

GAME                    -game directory
 - Meshes               - from this directory run aod2msk 
 - Textures             - in this directory store textures in TEX format
